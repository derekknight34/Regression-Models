Fantasy Hockey Points Prediction
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting "Next Year's Fantasy Points" (NextYearFPs) for hockey players, an essential metric for fantasy hockey leagues and player performance analysis. The model aims to leverage historical player statistics to forecast future performance, using machine learning and other regression techniques.

Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from QuantHockey and consists of various player statistics. Key features include player performance metrics from past seasons (excluding features such as rank, current year points, etc.). The dataset was preprocessed to ensure suitability for the predictive model.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Included feature selection, data splitting, and feature scaling.
Modeling: A Gradient Boosting Regressor was employed due to its robustness in handling non-linear relationships.
Evaluation: Model performance was assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.

Requirements

    Python 3
    Pandas
    Scikit-Learn
